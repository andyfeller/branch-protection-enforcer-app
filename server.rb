          :#{branch_protection[:required_pull_request_reviews] ? 'white_check_mark' : 'black_square_button'}: **Require pull request reviews before merging**
          _When enabled, all commits must be made to a non-protected branch and submitted via a pull request with the required number of approving reviews and no changes requested before it can be merged into a branch that matches this rule._

          - **Required approving reviews**: #{branch_protection[:required_pull_request_reviews] ? branch_protection[:required_pull_request_reviews][:required_approving_review_count] : ''}

          - :#{branch_protection[:required_pull_request_reviews] && branch_protection[:required_pull_request_reviews][:dismiss_stale_reviews] ? 'white_check_mark' : 'black_square_button'}: **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed**
            _New reviewable commits pushed to a matching branch will dismiss pull request review approvals._

          - :#{branch_protection[:required_pull_request_reviews] && branch_protection[:required_pull_request_reviews][:require_code_owner_reviews] ? 'white_check_mark' : 'black_square_button'}: **Require review from Code Owners**

          _Choose which status checks must pass before branches can be merged into a branch that matches this rule. When enabled, commits must first be pushed to another branch, then merged or pushed directly to a branch that matches this rule after status checks have passed._

          - :#{branch_protection[:required_status_checks] && branch_protection[:required_status_checks][:strict] ? 'white_check_mark' : 'black_square_button'}: **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
            _This ensures pull requests targeting a matching branch have been tested with the latest code. This setting will not take effect unless at least one status check is enabled (see below)._

          :#{branch_protection[:required_conversation_resolution][:enabled] ? 'white_check_mark' : 'black_square_button'}: **Require conversation resolution before merging**
          _When enabled, all conversations on code must be resolved before a pull request can be merged into a branch that matches this rule._

  # If they are the sameâ€”that is, we are running this file directly, call the
  # Sinatra run method
  run! if __FILE__ == $0
